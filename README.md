# Learning Performance Estimation

This repository contains teaching ressources about performance estimation problems. In short, if you are interested in using worst-case analyses in the context of first-order optimization methods, those ressources might be of interest to you.

A friendly informal introduction to this formalism is available in this [blog post](https://francisbach.com/computer-aided-analyses/).

## Content

- The folder [Exercises](/Exercises/) contains a set of exercises (.pdf and latex source code) for getting familiar with performance estimation problems.
- The folder ['Exercises - codes'](/Exercises - codes/) contains the corresponding codes (with missing parts to be completed while doing the assignements).

## Contributing
If you want to correct some typos, or contribute to new exercises that you find relevant, please don't hesitate to do a pull request with your suggestions. We'll add you to the list of contributors.
