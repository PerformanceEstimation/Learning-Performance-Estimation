# Learning Performance Estimation

This repository contains teaching ressources about performance estimation problems. In short, if you are interested in using worst-case analyses in the context of first-order optimization methods, those ressources might be of interest to you.

A friendly informal introduction to this formalism is available in this [blog post](https://francisbach.com/computer-aided-analyses/).

## Content

- The document [Course.pdf](Course.pdf) contains a set of exercises (latex source code [here](Course.tex)) for getting familiar with performance estimation problems.
- The folder [Codes](/Codes/) contains the corresponding codes (with a few missing parts to be completed while doing the assignements for the main exercises).

## Contributing
